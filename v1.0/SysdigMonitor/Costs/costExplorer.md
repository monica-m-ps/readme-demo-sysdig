## Key Features

### Grouping

Use the **Group by** option to select which labels you want to group costs by. Use this option to group costs across any Kubernetes Namespace or Workload label.

### Filtering

Use the **Add Filter** option to filter the cost data by specific label values. For example, only return costs from production clusters. You can save or favorite filters for future use.

### Create New Report

From an existing Cost exploration, use the **Create New Report** to schedule a report.
